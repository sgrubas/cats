# Cluster Analysis of Trimmed Spectrograms (CATS)
Framework for detection and denoising of sparse signals in the time-frequency domain. 
Particularly, very useful in the detection and denoising of earthquakes. Soon, here will be a link to our paper/preprint.

# Installation
There are two ways to install the package:
1. `pip install git+https://github.com/sgrubas/cats.git`

2.   1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/sgrubas/cats.git`
     2. Open the `cats` directory with `setup.py` file
     3. Install: `python setup.py install` or `python setup.py develop` (for the flexible development mode)

## Dependencies
The package was tested on Python 3.9. See other dependencies in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/sgrubas/cats/blob/main/requirements.txt).

# Tutorials
- [See our tutorial on usage for the detection of seismic events](https://github.com/sgrubas/cats/blob/main/tutorials/DetectionTutorial.ipynb)
