# Cluster Analysis of Trimmed Spectrograms (CATS)
Framework for detection and denoising of sparse signals in time-frequency domain. This can be useful for detection and 
wavelet estimations of earthquakes and (micro)-seismic events.

Usage:
1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/sgrubas/cats.git`
2. Install command in the repository: `python setup.py`
3. [See tutorial on detection](https://github.com/sgrubas/cats/blob/main/examples/DetectionTutorial.ipynb)
